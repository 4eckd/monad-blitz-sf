# What to Build

<aside>

To help kickstart your brainstorming for Monad Blitz, we've put together a list of potential application ideas across various domains. Remember, **these are just suggestions of cool ideas and** you are absolutely encouraged to work on your own unique ideas that align with the spirit of innovation.

The best projects will often leverage Monad's high-performance capabilities (speed, high throughput, low transaction costs) to enable novel user experiences or powerful new backend functionalities. Think about what becomes possible when blockchain interactions are fast, cheap, and can handle significant load.

### AI Agent-Focused Use Cases

These leverage AI agents to automate, personalize, or secure payment flows, running efficiently on Monad's backend for real-time decision-making.

1. **Autonomous Invoice Settlement Agent**: Create an AI agent that automates B2B payments by parsing invoices (e.g., via OCR or text input) and settling via Monad smart contracts. 
2. **Shopping or Travel Booking Agent**: Build an AI agent that handles e-commerce or travel bookings, negotiating deals and executing payments on Monad. Integrate fiat on-ramps for seamless token swaps, using low fees for frequent micro-transactions like add-ons or refunds.
3. **Agent Journal for Social Insights**: Create an AI agent that lurks on platforms like X (Twitter), summarizing daily top events or trends. Users pay small fees on Monad to subscribe to personalized reports delivered via Telegram, with on-chain storage for verifiable history.
4. **AI-Powered Fraud Detection Agent**: Design an AI agent that monitors x402 payment transactions in real-time on Monad. Use simple ML models to flag anomalies like unusual spending patterns, integrating with smart contracts to pause suspicious transfers. 
5. **AI Agent Reputation System**: Develop an on-chain system where AI agent actions are recorded and reviewed by users on Monad. Leverage ERC-8004 and x402 payment histories to build reliable reputation for agent economy.

### Consumer Focused Use Cases

These emphasize user-facing products like apps or interfaces that integrate payments, blending UX design with Monad's performance for intuitive, responsive experiences.

1. **Mobile Payment Wallet with Social Features**: Prototype a wallet app (web or simple mobile mockup) on Monad for peer-to-peer payments, including social tipping or group splits.
2. **E-Commerce Payment Gateway**: Build a plug-and-play payment gateway for online stores, integrating Monad for crypto checkouts with fiat on-ramps. Handle high-throughput scenarios like flash sales, with features like one-click refunds. Test with a demo storefront to highlight how Monad enables sub-second settlements.
3. **Monopoly-Style Agent Economy Game**: Create a virtual world game on Monad where AI agents compete for resources, earning and spending tokens based on traits. Users pay to whitelist and bet on winners, sharing reward pools via automated, low-fee distributions.
4. **Agent Economy in Neural MMO:** Fork the open-source Neural MMO (multi-agent survival game env) and integrate x402 protocol on Monad. AI agents make autonomous micropayments for trades, resources, or alliances, enabling a real-stakes, high-throughput in-game economy with seamless HTTP-native payments.
5. **Tokenized Generative Worlds**: Tokenize AI-generated virtual worlds on Monad, gating access via token payments. Creators earn royalties from entry fees, while users pay to explore or train agents in these environments. Use Monad's scalability for real-time world minting and high-volume access transactions.

### Other Use Cases

These ideas center on real world use cases and core blockchain mechanics like smart contracts, token standards, or on-chain payment rails, optimized for Monad's high TPS to handle real-time, high-volume transactions.

1. **Micropayments for Content Creators**: Build a smart contract system on Monad that enables instant, low-fee micropayments for accessing digital content (e.g., articles, videos, or NFTs). Integrate with a simple frontend where users pay per view/second, leveraging Monad's speed to process thousands of small transactions without congestion. Bonus: Add royalty splits for collaborators.
2. **Cross-Chain Payment Bridge**: Create a lightweight bridge protocol that facilitates fast, secure payment transfers between Monad and another EVM chain (e.g., Ethereum or Polygon). Focus on atomic swaps for stablecoins, using Monad's throughput to minimize latency and fees. Include basic fraud-proofing via oracles for price feeds.
3. **Decentralized Subscription Service**: Develop a subscription model using recurring smart contract payments on Monad. Users stake tokens for ongoing access to services (e.g., SaaS tools or streaming), with automatic renewals and refunds. Exploit Monad's low costs to make micro-subscriptions viable for everyday use, like paying for API calls.
