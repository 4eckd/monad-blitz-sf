    - Necessary SDKs and tools (e.g., Node.js, npm/yarn, Python, Rust, Go, Hardhat, Foundry, Git, Docker if part of your workflow).
    - Any specific frameworks or libraries you anticipate using.
- **Any Necessary Adapters:** If your laptop requires specific adapters for power or peripherals, please bring them.
