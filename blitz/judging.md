# Judging Process & Criteria

## The judging process at Monad Blitz is community-driven, designed to celebrate the most innovative ideas that emerge during the day.

### **How Judging Works:**

1. **Submission Review:** All project submissions, including links to your public GitHub repository and your Monad Testnet deployment, will be made available for all participants to review. This allows everyone to explore the projects in more detail.
2. **Voting Platform Access:** Once the project presentations begin, all participating teams will gain access to a designated voting platform.
3. **Casting Your Votes:** During the presentations and for an **additional 15 minutes after the final demo concludes**, you will be able to vote for your favourite projects.
4. **Fair Play:** Teams will **not** be able to vote for their own project.
5. **Winners Announced:** After the 15-minute voting window closes, scores will be automatically tallied, and the top projects will be announced. Winners will be presented with their respective prizes.

### **Voting Criteria – The Innovation Lens:**

When voting, we encourage you to consider the following:

- **Novelty & Originality:** Does the project present a truly new idea, a unique application of technology, or a fresh approach to an existing problem?
- **Innovative Mechanics:** Does the project implement clever or novel mechanics, smart contract designs, or user interactions, especially those that leverage Monad's potential?
- **Problem-Solving:** Does the idea creatively address a real or interesting challenge for consumer applications?
- **Learning & Experimentation:** Does the project demonstrate a willingness to experiment, push boundaries, and learn, even if not every aspect is perfectly polished?

### **The Spirit of the Vote:**

- The primary goal is **not necessarily to identify the most polished or complete application.** Instead, we want to celebrate and reward the **new, innovative ideas and unique approaches** that everyone can learn from and be inspired by. Vote for the project that excited you the most with its ingenuity!
