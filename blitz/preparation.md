# Preparing for Your Project Demo

## Each team will have 3 **minutes** to present their project to all participants. This is your moment to shine and share what you've built!

### **Presentation Focus:**

Your demo should primarily cover:

1. **The Live Demo:** Show us your project in action on the Monad Testnet! This should be the core of your presentation.
2. **How You Built It (Briefly):** What key Monad features or tools did you use? Any interesting technical challenges you overcame?
3. **Key Areas of Innovation:** What makes your project new, unique, or a novel solution? Why is it exciting?

### **Slide Deck – Optional, Not Required:**

- You are **not required** to prepare a slide deck. Many impactful demos are purely live.
- However, if a few simple slides (e.g., for architecture, problem statement, or innovation points) help you structure your 5-minute presentation effectively, you are welcome to use them. Keep them minimal and visual.

### **Your Audience: Fellow Developers!**

Remember, you're not presenting to a panel of VCs or non-technical judges. Your audience is your peers – skilled developers who are interested in the tech, the idea, and the execution. Consider:

- What would impress *you* as a developer?
- What technical aspects or innovative mechanics would they find most interesting?
- Keep it concise, engaging, and focused on the "wow" factor of your creation.

### **Tips for an Effective & Timely Demo:**

- **Practice Your Timing:** 3 minutes is short! Rehearse your demo multiple times to ensure you can cover your key points smoothly within the limit.
- **Focus on the Core Innovation:** Don't try to show every single feature. Highlight what's most unique and exciting.
- **Prepare for Demo Gremlins:** Live demos can be unpredictable. Have a backup plan:
    - Take screenshots of key functionalities.
    - Record a short video of your project working as a fallback.
    - Ensure your Testnet deployment is stable.
- **Clear "What" and "Why":** Quickly explain what your project is and why it's innovative or solves a particular problem.
- **Get to the Demo Fast:** Minimize intro talk and dive into showing your application.
- **Speak Clearly & Enthusiastically:** Your passion for your project is contagious!
