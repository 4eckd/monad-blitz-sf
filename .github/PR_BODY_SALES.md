## Objection Handling Examples

### "We'll just hire a DevOps engineer"
**Response:** "That's a great long-term plan! But hiring takes 3-6 months. We can get you set up in 24 hours, and your new DevOps engineer will thank you for the head start."

### "This seems expensive"
**Response:** "Consider the alternative: Your lead developer spending 2-3 weeks figuring this out (at $100-150/hour = $16K-36K in opportunity cost). We're the fast, affordable option."

### "We're too early-stage"
**Response:** "That's exactly why you need this. Early-stage is when bad DevOps habits form. Starting with solid automation means you'll never have to 'fix' it later."
