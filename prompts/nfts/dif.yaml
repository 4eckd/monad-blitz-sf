# Color Theme Application Instructions
# This file defines how to apply the rarity-determined color theme

Apply the selected {color_theme} uniformly to:
- headline text glow
- ASCII skull neon edges
- command-line glow intensity
- border light
- waveform accents
- sponsor logo tint

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT change structure — only color palette and glow modulation
- The {color_theme} is determined by {rarity_seed}, NOT randomly
- Same seed = same color theme = identical visual output
- This ensures testnet NFT = mainnet NFT (same appearance)

Color Theme Intensity Levels by Rarity:
- COMMON: Moderate glow (60% intensity)
- UNCOMMON: Enhanced glow (70% intensity)
- RARE: Strong glow (80% intensity)
- ULTRA RARE: Intense glow (90% intensity)
- LEGENDARY: Maximum glow (100% intensity + chromatic aberration)
